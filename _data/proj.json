        "description": "Explored different methods for dealing with imbalanced dataset like, Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset with only 0.2 percent of transactions being classified as fraudulent. Compared scores of various metrics on methods like oversampling minority class, undersampling majority class, generate synthetic samples using SMOTE. Employed various algorithms like CNN, Linear Regression and Random Forests Classifier for classification"
